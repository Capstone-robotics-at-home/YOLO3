## The model weights are uploaded to the Google Drive 
* Put two **.pth** files to _'model_data'_ folder 
* Training sets are not uploaded because you don't need them if you want to train your own set

## Usage: 
* predict file for single image detecting 
* video file for detecting objects in videos
